# NLP-text-classification-CNN
This is my first attempt at Text Classification using CNNs.

28th Oct - Friday Night 

Stopped at finding the max length for train, valid and test,
Before finding this, we need to process the test dataset [the crawled data] to look similar to the trianing and validation set:
1. Change the labels POSITIVE and NEGATIVE to 'pos' and 'neg' - DONE
2. Run clean_text and remove_url through the text - DONE

Need to make the test dataset go through the processing that the trianing and validaiton went through!
