# NLP-text-classification-CNN
This is my first attempt at Text Classification using CNNs.
The data used here was data that was obtained from crawling reddit titles.

The models as well as other training related artifacts are stored in the Google Drive.

This CNN Network can be further improved to increase the accuracy.

Tokenisation -> Texts to Sequences -> Padding -> CNN 

No lemmatization or stemming done.
